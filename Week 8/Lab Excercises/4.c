// The students in a particular college were given the task to purchase the rope for highlighting the boundary of their football ground. They didnâ€™t know how many feet rope need to be purchased. Could you help these students by writing a C program having preprocessor macros with arguments to compute the circumference of the football ground that will help them in purchasing the rope.

//  Input Format :  The first line contains an integer a that denotes the length of the football ground. The second line contains the integer b that denotes the width.

//  Output Format : The output should print the circumference of the football ground in integer. 

//  Sample Input

// 20

// 40

// Sample Output

// Circumference is 120

#include <stdio.h>
#define circum(a,b) (2*a + 2*b)
int main(){
    int a,b;
    scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
    printf("Circumference is %d",circum(a,b));
}
