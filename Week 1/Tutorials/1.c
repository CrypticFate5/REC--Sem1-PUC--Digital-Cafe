// The student strength at your college has crossed the 1000 mark now. The small stationary shop opposite to your college is not able to cater to the growing stationary needs of your college student community. The students have to always wait in a long queue to purchase stationary items. The shop-keeper is very weak in Mathematics and he always takes long time to do even simple addition. The shop-keeper's poor mathematical skills annoyed your college students as they had to wait for a long time in the queue. The current first year batch of your college have started learning C programming and they decided to help the shop-keeper by writing a program to add two numbers.
